# The SASS-iest of SASS Builds

Homework 1 for Authoring 3 by Nic Amerongen

Utilizing the framework of a school webpage, I have redistributed the contents of the css folder into a new master.css file. Using SASS I have divided up the content sorted by various categories such as main, nav and sidebar.

I have a habit of non-destructive editing and so anything that I moved into scss modules I have just commented out of the css file and left them written out and the file linked in HTML.
